

This is the DNS tunneling proxy project server. It must be started at where the NS entry of the domain 
is pointed. Protocol doesn't protect all the data inside so you better not to use this for security 
data transfers. In fact, the only purpose it's built is "googling" from the areas blocked by a local 
firewall (such as the university local network).

You probably should firstly configure the server in "ebin/arya.app". All the parameters are either 
commented or having a name speaks itself. If neither, it's better not to touch that. All the numeric 
parameters were optimal for our network, but you may change them if your network isn't proper (for example, 
you could change TCP timeout if you're about to download old self-hosted websites). Pay attention: it 
you're changing TCP timeout, you almost always are to change client's DNS timeout too. 

Logging levels are not clear, so here's the description:
	0: Only errors, with data;
	1: Waypoints, without data;
	2: Waypoints, with one-string data (PIDs, tokens, etc.);
	3: All the data — packets, requests, etc.
	
The default (and the best) value is 0. You may change it to -1 to avoid all the output (except OTP error 
messages), but this's unsafe.
